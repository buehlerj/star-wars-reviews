      <h1>Rebels</h1>
      <p>Below is a table with every episode of Star Wars Rebels. It is sorted by my own personal ranking</p>
      <p>Each season is color-coded according to the key to the right, going from red to green.</p>
      <p>The ranking sorts each individual episode based off my own personal opinion. I compared every single episode
        against each other and ended up with this list.</p>
      <p>Feel free to sort the table out by Season, Name, Rank, or Release Order!
      <p>There is also a link to watch any of these Rebels episodes if you have a Disney+ account! Click on the icon at
        the right to open it up there!</p>
      <p>Note: The episode "Jedi Night" will remain unranked on my list. If you have seen this episode, then you
        probably know why. Jedi Night holds a very special place in Star Wars Canon, and I do not think I can place it
        anywhere on this list and do it justice.</p>
