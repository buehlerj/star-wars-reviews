    "Obi Wan and Qui-Gon alone are enough to sell this book. Their master and apprentice dynamic is so cool. We get insight on how they both feel about being paired together, and it reflects the Phantom Menace so well. There are heavy prophecies in this book, and how they influenced Qui-Gon (and those around him) builds so much back story. The story is not really the main point of this book, it really is more about the characters. That said, the story is so incredible! The characters, environment, and political issues in Pijal were so dang interesting!",

    "This is a Young Adult reader, and it really feels that way! Haha Kanan acts like a teenager looking for love whenever he interacts with women. It's kinda funny, but I think I would have related better if I read this when I was in middle/high school more.",

    "Dooku's story leaving the Jedi Order feels a little rushed. Some motivations are present and definite, but when he leaves it feels like there wasn't enough to it. This book (like Ahsoka) is more about the character progression than the story itself.",

Temmin is loveable and you're rooting for him the entire time. Great characters, and honestly a really good story! Also, the interludes are really interesting!",
    "I'm not a big fan of the writing. There are so many analogies in this book that try to make you think it's Star Wars, like if the author wanted to say Temmin was eating cold soup, he would say \"Temmin sips on the soup as cold as a Hoth icicle\" or \"Temmin sips soup as thick as the swamps of Dagobah\". Yeah, we get that the book is in Star Wars, use the story to portary that, not the constant plugs.",

In this one, we don't have the entire team together, they're all split up to do their own things, which leads to many story lines that all colide in the end.",

Notably, Wedge Antilles gets a very interesting role in the story, one that introduces family struggle and the everyday life of a person in the New Republic. Rae Sloan's role seems small, but it is perfectly set up for her to become the main protagonist in the next book.",
    "It was just boring! I feel like there were 3 things total that happen in this book. My friend sumarized it best, the book starts to get good when they finally meet up with the person they're looking for, but this happens about halfway through the book. I can hardly remember the first half of the book, and could probably sumarize the entire story in just a few sentences. ",

    "Light of the Jedi",
    "This start to the High Republic blew away my expectations, and my expectations were very high. The highlight of this book are the new characters, and every one of them was unique and memorable. The base story line of the book got me invested in how it would all turn out and I found myself sitting down to read and losing track of time. Concepts like the Force and Hyperspace are explored in new and very different and exciting ways, which gives me high hopes for the future of the High Republic.",
    "You are immediately thrown into the action so it was difficult to keep track of all the new characters. The first Act is very long considering it takes place over the span of 3 hours. The second act is a little drawn out too. I'd say the biggest downfall of this book is the length.",

    "Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising",
    "As is the case with the other Thrawn books, the characters are really great. We get to know a new Skywalker and her caretaker, as well as a few political leaders. There is a slight twist near the end that nearly blew my mind. The Memories sections are well timed and give good insight to Thrawn's uprising in the Ascendancy. The new species and locations are really exciting too, giving much more universe building material. And the hidden-dagger style politics of the Chiss families was very well portrayed. I'm really looking forward to the rest of this trilogy.",
    "You need a PHD in Chiss politics to keep up with the characters in this book. I stopped following them in the See Characters section, but you can see that any Chiss could be called up to 4 different things, and some of them change their families which means they change their names furthermore. It was difficult to remember which name belonged to which character, and if they were for or against Thrawn. Story wise, not a lot seems to really happen until the last puzzle. This book felt like it was made to set up the Chiss Ascendancy for the next 2 books in this trilogy.",

    "Into The Dark",
    "The characters stand out so well. We get to follow padawan Reath Silas, who is a bookworm jedi. He doesn't crave adventure, but is thrown into it. We also meet the crew of the Vessel, and every one of them (especially Geode) are interesting and have quirky personalities. We get introduced to a new type of Jedi, the Wayseeker, which just goes to expands the lore. This was a fun, and sometimes spooky, book to read. We also get introduced to a new villain for the Jedi.",
    "This book did not really seem to have a massive impact on the Star Wars universe. The story was alright and the characters were good, but this is definitely not a must-read to keep up with the High Republic. I'm curious to see what happens to the non-Jedi characters though.",

    "Thrawn Ascendancy: Greater Good",
    "As usual, the space battles are amazing. Thrawn's tactical analysis of war and his enemy is as good as ever here, and that alone makes this a must read. Each winding path and story told in the book concludes in a very satisfying way. How this book fits into the overall timeline is also very satisfying, and the ending of this book saved it greatly for me. I think my favorite thing to come of this new Thrawn trilogy is the world building and lore around the Chiss families. This was something I grew to love and understand, and the breadth of political and non-political decision making based on family was very well done.",
    "This book focuses less on Thrawn and more on the overall situation that the Chaos is in, which isn't a bad thing. The secondary characters are still very interesting. This book does feel like Thrawn is making a lot of guesses rather than decisions based on certainty and analysis, as he would in other books. Even though I loved the family politics in this book, it was difficult to keep up with everyone's allegiances, something I'm sure would be better with a second reading.",

    "Some of the character development didn't make much sense to me, there was a lot of switching sides without good enough motivation. Also, this story was told as a re-telling of historic events, and every time we went back to the present away from Phasma's origins, it was a huge interruption and annoyance.",
